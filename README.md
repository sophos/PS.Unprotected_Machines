# Unprotected_Machines
This will compare all the machines in every Sophos Central MSP/EDB/Single Console and Active Directory. It will list all the machines not protected by Sophos Central and when those machines last spoke to a Domain Controller. Please follow the PDF guide

This script replaces the previous scripts Unprotected_Machines_EDB_MSP and Unprotected_Machines_Single_Tenant scripts into one script

v2.14
Fixed an issue when the script was run against a Sophos Central Enterprise Dashboard
